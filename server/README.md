# Server Scripts
These are the simple small scripts shared for solving basic tasks in SharePoint

## ðŸš« Disclaimer
These scripts are delivere "as is", and I do expected you check them before running them in a production environment.
Even though I do my best to put in failsafes in my live scripts, they are usually tested once or twice in my environment.

## ðŸ˜… Functioning commits
Yes I have shared some commits that works, but they aren't pretty. Use them for learning.

### openfile.html
This is not a script, but a solution to connect some serverapplication links to SharePoint.<br>
The usecase is for when a program needs to link to a process or similar on local file share.<br>
The script is a file that opens a sharepoint-link (or other) within. Thus you can link to the file, but it'll take you to an online storage.
