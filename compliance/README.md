# Compliance Scripts
These are the simple small scripts shared for solving basic tasks in regarding Purview Compliance

## ðŸš« Disclaimer
These scripts are delivere "as is", and I do expected you check them before running them in a production environment.
Even though I do my best to put in failsafes in my live scripts, they are usually tested once or twice in my environment.

## ðŸ˜… Functioning commits
Yes I have shared some commits that works, but they aren't pretty. Use them for learning.

### Get-AdminChanges
A useful script to track changes done in admin-center.
