# Modules
These modules are not used stand alone, but as a part of other scripts.

Since they as .psm1 files, you need to Import the Modules.

## ðŸš« Disclaimer
These scripts are delivere "as is", and I do expected you check them before running them in a production environment.
Even though I do my best to put in failsafes in my live scripts, they are usually tested once or twice in my environment.

### Get-AllModules
Install all modules in the folder at once.

### Get-PSversion
Check if you are using Core or Desktop and return.

### Get-RandomPassword
Get a randomized password to use in you applications.
