# M365-Scripts
These are the simple small scripts shared for solving basic tasks in Microsoft 365

## Disclaimer
These scripts are delivere "as is", and I do expected you check them before running them in a production environment.
Even though I do my best to put in failsafes in my live scripts, they are usually tested once or twice in my environment.

## ‚≠ê Proud commits
A list with explaination of my public scripts that work and are useful.

### Get-TenantID.ps1
