# M365-Scripts
These are the simple small scripts shared for solving basic tasks in Microsoft 365

## Disclaimer
These scripts are delivere "as is", and I do expected you check them before running them in a production environment.
Even though I do my best to put in failsafes in my live scripts, they are usually tested once or twice in my environment.

## ‚≠ê Proud commits
These are some scripts I'm happy with.

* azure / Get-TenantID.ps1
* endpoint / Set-DeviceOwnership.ps1
* teams / Clear-TeamsCache.ps1
