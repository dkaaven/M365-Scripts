# SharePoint Scripts
These are the simple small scripts shared for solving basic tasks in SharePoint

## ðŸš« Disclaimer
These scripts are delivere "as is", and I do expected you check them before running them in a production environment.
Even though I do my best to put in failsafes in my live scripts, they are usually tested once or twice in my environment.

## ðŸ˜… Functioning commits
Yes I have shared some commits that works, but they aren't pretty. Use them for learning.

### Get-SPOSiteUsers
Get all users and members from all sharepoint sites in a tenant. <br>
NB. This works but isn't very useful since you need to be an admin and have ownership of sites.
